# ZewReader
The aim of this software is to facilitate reading the text faster. The main idea is about focus on the words instead of the whole
paragraph. Based on the habits, we are able to skim a paragraph for key points. Now, we are able to skim a paragraph by seeing 
the words in front of out eyes with customized speed and font size. 
A progress bar will show our progress and the software also equipped with a build-in Acrobat reader to help following the images 
and equations.
